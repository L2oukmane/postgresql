# postgreSQl first database

> This is my first database in PostgreSQL

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](https://github.com/L2oukmane/postgresql/blob/first-tutorial/schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](https://github.com/L2oukmane/postgresql/blob/first-tutorial/data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](https://github.com/L2oukmane/postgresql/blob/first-tutorial/queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
